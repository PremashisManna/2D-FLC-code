This is 2D fluorscence lifetime correlation (2D-FLC) code orginially written by Toru Kondo (toru.kondo.c8@tohoku.ac.jp) while at Schlau-Cohen Lab at MIT.

Tutorial for the codes are in the pdf document named "A Technical Note on 2D-FLC.pdf"

All the matlab files can be found in the folder "MatlabCodes".

A synthetic data (simulated_data.mat) is also included with if instrumentation response function (IRF.mat).

It is advisable to work with a simulated data first before analyzing the real data.
